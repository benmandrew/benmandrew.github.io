Mine and two friend's entry into the Ludum Dare 48 Game Jam, following the theme 'Deeper and Deeper'. It was built over 72 sleep-deprived hours.

This attempt wasn't as ambitious as previous ones, due to people moving, meeting with friends, revision, and general shenanigans. However we're all very proud of what we managed to make! It's very concise and feels more well-made (read: less janky) than previous attempts.

We have a global leaderboard where you can upload your high scores, but it's very competitive; I'm pretty sure a few speedrunners have optimised their route to perfection. But maybe you can prove me wrong!

We also had a couple of streamers play our game which was awesome! There are a couple of VODs linked down below :)
