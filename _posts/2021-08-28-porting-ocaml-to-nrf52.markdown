A talk given to Tarides colleagues and others in the OCaml ecosystem on the 28th September 2021, to demonstrate the work and research I had done over the internship.

##### Abstract:

> In this talk I will explain how we can run OCaml bytecode on a memory-constrained bare-metal device, using the RIOT operating system as a base layer.
