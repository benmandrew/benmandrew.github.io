A largely unfinished project that I've abandoned, so please don't judge too harshly :)

While very incomplete, it's still kind of fun by itself. There are most likely many bugs.

##### Instructions:

- WASD to move, move mouse to aim.
- Fire continuously by holding the left mouse button.
- Pickup powerups after each wave by pressing E when over them.
- If you have a powerup, press SPACE to activate it.
- Get to the highest wave possible!

##### Enemies:

- Zombies chase you directly and try to overwhelm you by sheer numbers.
- Bats move fast and try to hit you in fly-by attacks.
- Jumpers teleport around the map, shooting fireballs at you whenever they can.
- Bloaters look exactly like zombies, except on death they explode into a cloud of poisonous gas.
- Shields give their protection to other enemies, making them invincible until the shield is dealt with.
