# Logic and Proof supervisions

This course has three supervisions over the Lent term. I recommend you and your partner book all of your supervisions NOW --- this will help to prevent supervisions bleeding into your well-earned holidays:) (If none of the available times on KuDoS work for you, please let me know.)

I prefer submitted work to be LaTeXed. If you're finding it difficult to lay out proof trees, here's a LaTeX package for proof-building to avoid the nested `frac{}{}` malarkey ([link](https://www.logicmatters.net/resources/ndexamples/proofsty.html)).

## Supervision 1

1. Parts (b) and (c) of 2017P6Q6 ([link](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/exams/pastpapers/y2017p6q6.pdf))
2. Part (b) of 2015P6Q6 ([link](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/exams/pastpapers/y2015p6q6.pdf))
3. Parts (a) and (b) of 2010P6Q6 ([link](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/exams/pastpapers/y2010p6q6.pdf))
4. I am trying to prove safety properties of digital circuits with a theorem prover using propositional logic. What are the practical advantages and disadvantages of using first-order logic for this application instead? (Hint: what's the domain?)

## Supervision 2

1. Part (a) of 2019P6Q9 ([link](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/exams/pastpapers/y2019p6q9.pdf))
2. 2016P6Q5 ([link](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/exams/pastpapers/y2016p6q5.pdf))
3. Assuming the three statements (a) $$H \rightarrow M \vee N$$, (b) $$M \rightarrow K \wedge P$$, and (c) $$N \rightarrow L \wedge P$$, prove $$H \rightarrow P$$ using *clause resolution*.
4. 2020P6Q9 ([link](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/exams/pastpapers/y2020p6q9.pdf))
5. (Optional) --- From the notes, DPLL has five steps. For each, justify why it is necessary for the algorithm to work.

## Supervision 3 

1. Part (b) of 2019P6Q10. For (i) and (ii) use tableau calculus, for (iii) use sequent calculus. ([link](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/exams/pastpapers/y2019p6q10.pdf))
2. Part (b) of 2019P6Q9 ([link](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/exams/pastpapers/y2019p6q9.pdf))
3. Part (d) of 2021P6Q10 ([link](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/exams/pastpapers/y2021p6q10.pdf))
4. 2016P6Q6 ([link](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/exams/pastpapers/y2016p6q6.pdf))
